## MetaAI Powered Assistant Guide

## Model Used

My Meta.ai used Llama 2 70B
 though that of Mr Andrew Brown our Tutor used Llama 3 70B. I have a feeling that it might be because of my system limitations. And the Chatbot told me that it's currently using a composite model, instead of single model that our tutors model used/

For context, this is the response when asked if it uses a single model:

"I'm a composite model, meaning I'm a combination of several models, including LLaMA 2 70B, that work together to generate responses. This allows me to leverage the strengths of different models and provide more accurate and informative answers."


### Prompting Guides

Tutor observed that Llama does not have any special prompting requirement to best understand context like models.
