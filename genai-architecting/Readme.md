## Functional Requirements

The company wants to invest in owning their infrastructure.
The reason is because of their concern on privacy of data of user data.
and also the cost of managed services for GenAI will greatly raise cost overtime.

they want to invest on AI PC where they can afford to spend 20-40k on the infrastructrue.
They have 1000 students and they are located within europe, south america and north america.

## Assumptions

We are assuming that the open source LLM we use will be powerful enough to run on 40k infrasture with bandwith for 1300 student, though we currently have enrolled 1000 students, but considering scalability, we are assuming 1300.

## Data Strategy

considering copyright concerns, we must purchase an already filtered data set and store them in our database.

## Technical considerations

We are considering use IBM Granites because its a true open source model with training data that is traceable to avoid copyright violation. ref: https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite
